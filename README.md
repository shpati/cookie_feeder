# Cookie Feeder 2.0

## What is Cookie Feeder?

Cookie Feeder is a tiny program that is used to deliver short messages contained in a simple text file. The messages or "cookies" can be jokes, quotations, thoughts, song lyrics, stories, exam questions (to exercise like with flashcards) or even random numbers! Anyone can modify the text file or use his/her own text file that contains the wanted messages. 


## How to use it?

Cookie Feeder is accessible through the icon tray of windows. To get a "cookie", just click once the cookie icon in the icon tray. To get another one, click on the "More" button. If you close the cookie feeder window, the program will be running in the background and the icon will still be in the icon tray. To exit the program, right click the cookie icon in the icon tray and select the option "Exit". 


## How to change the cookies?

To change the cookies, you must change the text file that is associated with the program, i.e. cookie file. Each cookie entry is saved as a separate line in the file. The program will read a line at random every time it looks for a cookie. 


## Where to find cookies?

You can find them everywhere: they are jokes, famous quotes, movie quotes, history facts, thoughts, song lyrics and so on. I give you a hint: Google! :) It can be a good idea to create a different file for each type of cookie (e.g. Jokes cookie file, quotes cookie file...) 


## How much does this program cost? Can I copy it/distribute?

The program is a free and made available under the MIT license, so you can do whatever you want with the code. 


## What kind of operating system is the program compatible with?

Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/7/8/10. Needs no additional libraries, runtime components, .net framework, etc.
