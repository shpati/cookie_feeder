# Cookie Feeder v1.0

## 1. What is cookie feeder?

Cookie Feeder is a tiny program that is used to deliver short 
messages contained in a simple text file. The messages or 
"cookies" can be jokes, quotations, thoughts, song lyrics, 
stories, exam questions (to exercise like with flashcards) or 
even random numbers! Anyone can modify the text file or 
use his/her own text file that contains the wanted 
messages. 


## 2. How to use it?

Cookie Feeder is accessible through the icon tray of 
windows. To get a "cookie", just click once the cookie icon 
in the icon tray. To get another one, click on the "More" 
button. If you close the cookie feeder window, the program 
will be running in the background and the icon will still be in 
the icon tray. To exit the program, right click the cookie icon 
in the icon tray and select the option "Exit". If you want to 
make the program load automatically each time windows 
starts up, right click the cookie icon and select the option 
"Start with windows", you will see the option ticked. 
Otherwise make sure that this option is unticked in order to 
disable the automatic loading of the program. 


## 3. How to change the "cookies"?

To change the cookies, you must change the text file that is 
associated with the program. The text file has a *.txt filetype 
and is normally located in the same folder as the program, 
depending on where you have extracted it. Otherwise you 
can choose your own file by right-clicking the cookie icon in 
the icon tray and selecting the option "Load Cookies...". 
The file itself must be text only, and every cookie within the 
file is separated by a line containing only the three 
consecutive characters ###. The file starts with a ### line 
and after every cookie there is a ### line. That is the only 
rule, within these lines characters you can write your 
message 
(i.e. cookie). 


## 4. Where to find cookies?

You can find them everywhere: they are jokes, famous 
quotes, movie quotes, history facts, thoughts, song lyrics 
and so on. I give you a hint: Google! :) It can be a good 
idea to create a different file for each type of cookie (e.g. 
Jokes cookie file, quotes cookie file...) You can probably 
create some cookies yourself and share them in the blog:

## 5. How much does this program cost? Can I copy 
it/distribute?

The program is a freeware. Copy and distribute it, but leave 
it as it is. It is made in Visual Basic and honestly it took very 
little time to make...


## 6. Do you accept suggestions? Can we report bugs to the 
blog?

Yes, not only suggestions and bugs, but also your cookies if 
you can, mmmmm. Btw: no spam!


## 7. Who is responsible if after running the program, my 
house catches fire, my city gets devastated by a hurricane, 
I get sick, my dog bites the neighbor, or the computer starts 
smelling (and tasting probably) like fresh baked cookies?

Not me, I am not responsible for any damage associated 
with the usage or misusage of the cookie feeder.... but if 
any of the above or similar cases happen to you, it might be 
a good idea to warn other users at: http://cookie-
feeder.blogspot.com


## 8. What kind of operating system is the program compatible with?

Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, 7, 8, 10 (you may need to place the OCX file included in the same folder as the main program)
